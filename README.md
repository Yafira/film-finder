# film-finder

- Using my knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a basic movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre.
  - Youâ€™ll be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion.
- This project uses the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">The Movie Database</a> (TMDB) API.
  - Please use your own key or register for one by creating an account on TMDB and following the instructions in the link above.
